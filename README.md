## Do I need this?

For players, this library is only necessary if a mod requires it as a
dependency.
However, for developers, this library is useful if they want to create blocks
with different parts,
surpassing Minecraft's limitations of predefined BlockStates.
With this API, you can implement Parts that have different PartStates and
individual PartEntities.
